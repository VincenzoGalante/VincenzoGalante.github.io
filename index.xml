      <description>These last early mornings and late evenings have been filled with setting up my environment for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp.
My current setup involves a virtual machine, hosting a Postgres database, while being able to query it through pgAdmin - pulling it all up via docker-compose. Furthermore, I got to know the basics on how to set up the Google Cloud infrastructure via Terraform.
Within the next weeks, I will be working on workflow orchestration via Prefect, data warehousing in BigQuery, analytics engineering with DBT, and batch and stream processing with Kafka.</description>

      <title>Where to start?</title>

      <description>I wanted to learn more about data. How can data be stored? How do I get data from A to B? And how do I present data in a Dashboard? But where do you start when you have humanities complete knowledge at your fingertip?
I felt overwhelmed, and still do. And it is totally okay. We all need time to adjust and sort things out.
I started with the basics of the fundamental languages used for data jobs - SQL and Python.</description>

      <description>Hello out there, this is my first post.
This is the start of a wonderful learning journey full of ups and downs, new insights and learnings.
The name of this blog is based on the UK band &amp;ldquo;Frankie goes to Hollywood&amp;rdquo;.
So, relax, take a seat and enjoy the ride.

      <description>Hi there,
I am Vincenzo and this is my journey into Data.
From being a consultant for haute couture brands in Paris, to running strategic initiatives for the biggest european ecommerce platforms in Berlin - I already had some stations in my career.
Over the last years I learned how to think like a product manager and gained hands-on full stack web development skills, just to find my true passion now.</description>
