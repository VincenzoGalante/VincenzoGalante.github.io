      <description>Where do you start when you have humanities complete knowledge at your fingertip? I wanted to learn more about data - but how? I felt overwhelmed, and still do. And it is totally okay. We need time to adjust and sort things out.
I started with the basics of the fundamental languages used for data tasks - SQL and Python - paired with expert interviews. It helped me to understand where I stand, where I want to go and how the road ahead is looking.</description>

      <description>Hi there,
I am Vincenzo and this is my journey into Data.
From being a consultant for haute couture brands in Paris, analyzing data for the biggest european ecommerce platforms in Berlin, I already made some stops. Over the last years I learned how to think like a product manager and gained hands-on full stack web development skills, just to find my true passion now.
I am a true lifelong learner and a true autodidact.</description>
